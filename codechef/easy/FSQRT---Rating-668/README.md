## Problem

### Finding Square Roots

 *In olden days finding square roots seemed to be difficult but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many languages* .

Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance.

### Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. Each line contains an integer N whose square root needs to be computed.

### Output

For each line of the input, output the square root of the input integer, rounded down to the nearest integer, in a new line.

### Constraints

1<=T<=20
1<=N<=10000

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
10
5
10000
```

```
3
2
100
```

class Codechef
{
	public static void main (String[] args) throws java.lang.Exception
	{
		// your code goes here
		
		Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
		
		int T =sc.nextInt();
		while(T-->0){
		    int N = sc.nextInt();
		    System.out.println((int)Math.sqrt(x));
		}
		
		

	}
}
